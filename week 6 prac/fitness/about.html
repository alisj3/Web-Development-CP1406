                <dt>Burpee</dt>
                    <dd>Burpees are a great full-body exercise to increase your strength andendurance. 
                        Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend yourhands forward, 
                        kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, and thenjump up from a squatted 
                        position. </dd>
                <dt>Plank</dt>
                Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push-upposition and 
                rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position as long as youcan. </dd>
                <dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
                <dd>Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on thefloor in a 
                    push-up position, bring one knee up to your chest, and then switch asquickly as 
                    you can (as though you are climbing a mountain).</dd>
